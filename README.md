The name of the project is a game called Tic-Tac-Toe.
The winning Logic of the game is as follows:
i.The game is played on a 3x3 grid, where two players take turns marking the cells in the grid with their respective symbols (usually 'X' and 'O').
ii.The objective of the game is to be the first player to get three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.
iii.If we assign indexes to the cells of the grid(0->8),a player would win the game if he manages to mark his/her symbols in the following indexes:-
[[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8],
        [0, 3, 6], [1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8],
        [0, 4, 8], [2, 4, 6]]
